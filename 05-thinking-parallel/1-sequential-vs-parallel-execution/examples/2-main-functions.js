/* main functions

  you should use `await` inside an async function
  but this can be inconvenient if you want to just write a script

  one way around this is putting your script in an async function
  then you call the function to run your script
  it's conventional to call this function `main`

  you won't need this for your projects
  but you will see it around the internet
