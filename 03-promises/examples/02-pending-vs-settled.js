  promises can be in one of three states:
  - pending (not settled):
      neither `resolve` nor `reject` have been called
      no errors have occurred in the executor
  - fulfilled (settled):
      `resolve` was called
  - rejected (settled):
      `reject` was called
      OR an error occurred

  if you inspect the promises in your console you will see two things:
    PromiseState: is the promise fulfilled, rejected or pending ?
    PromiseResult : the value passed into `resolve` or `reject`
